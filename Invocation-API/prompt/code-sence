You are a senior professor of software engineering.
Please classify the functions of each category based on your professional knowledge and the following 11 indicators that describe the responsibilities of the code.
Read the code and understand its functions. Each class may have more than one responsibility, if the responsibility is included, fill in "yes"; if not, write "no".

These 10 responsibilities are as follows:

1. String processing

Problems solved: Involving the creation, operation, parsing, formatting or conversion of strings. For example, processing text data preprocessing, generating reports or cleaning inputs.

Typical code: It includes methods such as string splitting, concatenation, replacement, and regular expression matching.

2. File operations

The problems solved: Handle the reading, writing, creation, deletion, path management or file content parsing of the file system. For example, read configuration files and export data preprocessing to CSV.

Typical code: including file read and write functions, directory traversal or file format processing (such as JSON/XML parsing).



3. Database operations

Problems solved: Handling database connections, queries, updates or transaction management. For example, perform SQL queries, operate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), or manage data preprocessing stores.

Typical code: including SQL execution methods, connection pool management or data preprocessing model definition.

4. Mathematical calculation

Problems to be solved: Performing numerical calculations, algorithm implementation or statistical analysis. For example, handling financial calculations, machine learning predictions or geometric operations.

Typical code: Involving mathematical functions, statistical models or optimization algorithms.

5. User Interface

Problems to be solved: Managing user interaction, interface rendering or event handling. For example, build Web front-end, desktop GUI or mobile interface.

Typical code: including UI component rendering, event listening or state management.

6. Business Logic

The problem to be solved: implementing specific business rules or domain logic related to specific applications. For example, e-commerce order processing, user permission verification or workflow engines.

Typical code: Encapsulate business processes, such as validation rules, decision trees, or service coordination.

7. Data Structures and Algorithms

The problem to be solved: managing data preprocessing sets, achieving efficient storage or operation. For example, handle lists, trees, graphs or caching mechanisms.

Typical code: including data preprocessing structure initialization, traversal or optimization methods (such as sorting, searching).

8. Systems and Tools

The problem to be solved: Provide general auxiliary functions or system-level operations, such as logging, error handling or process management. These codes are usually reused by other categories.

Typical code: utility functions, tool methods or system calls.

9. Concurrency and Multithreading

The problems solved: handling parallel execution, thread management or resource sharing. For example, implementing asynchronous tasks or avoiding race conditions.

Typical code: including thread pool management, lock mechanism or concurrent data preprocessing structure.

10. Exception handling

The exception handling mechanism of the unified management system.
